1. What is Python and why is it popular in Data Science?

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple syntax.
It is popular in Data Science due to libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

2. Difference between List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary

List is ordered and mutable, Tuple is ordered but immutable.
Set is unordered with unique values, Dictionary stores data as key-value pairs.

3. What is a Lambda function?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function written in one line.
It is mainly used for short, simple operations.

4. What is map(), filter(), reduce()?

map() applies a function to all items

filter() selects items based on a condition.

reduce() combines elements into a single value.

5. Difference between NumPy array and Python list

NumPy arrays are faster and memory-efficient for numerical operations.
Python lists are flexible but slower for mathematical computations.

6. What is Pandas used for?

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
It provides DataFrames for handling structured data easily.

7. How do you handle missing values?

Missing values can be removed or filled using mean, median, or mode.
The method depends on data size and importance of the feature.

8. Difference between loc and iloc

loc accesses data using labels (row/column names).
iloc accesses data using integer index positions.

9. What is Mean, Median, Mode?

Mean is the average, Median is the middle value.
Mode is the most frequently occurring value.

10. What is Variance and Standard Deviation?

Variance measures how far values spread from the mean.
Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

11. What is Correlation?

Correlation measures the relationship between two variables.
It ranges from -1 to +1 indicating negative or positive relation.

12. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning enables systems to learn from data automatically.
It improves performance without being explicitly programmed.

13. Types of Machine Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data.
Unsupervised uses unlabeled data, Reinforcement learns via rewards.

14. Difference between Regression and Classification

Regression predicts continuous values.
Classification predicts discrete class labels.

15. What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression models the relationship between input and output using a straight line.
It predicts continuous values.

16. What are assumptions of Linear Regression?

Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors.
Violating assumptions affects model accuracy.

17. What is R² score?

R² measures how well the model explains data variance.
Value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

18. What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems.
It outputs probabilities using a sigmoid function.

19. Why sigmoid function is used?

Sigmoid converts values into a range between 0 and 1.
This makes it suitable for probability-based classification.

20. Difference between Linear and Logistic Regression

Linear Regression predicts continuous output.
Logistic Regression predicts categorical output.

21. What is Margin in SVM?

Margin is the distance between the decision boundary and closest data points.
SVM tries to maximize this margin.

22. What are Support Vectors?

Support vectors are the closest data points to the margin.
They define the position of the decision boundary.

23. What is Kernel Trick?

Kernel trick transforms data into higher dimensions.
It helps SVM solve non-linear problems.

24. Types of Kernels

Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid kernels.
Each is used based on data complexity.

25. What is C parameter in SVM?

C controls the trade-off between margin size and classification error.
Higher C means less misclassification but smaller margin.

26. What is Train-Test Split?

It divides data into training and testing sets.
This helps evaluate model performance on unseen data.

27. Difference between Batch and Streaming

Batch processes data in chunks.
Streaming processes data in real time.

28. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load.
It is used to move and prepare data for analysis.

29. Difference between Bias and Variance

Bias is error due to oversimplified models.
Variance is error due to overly complex models.
